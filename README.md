# angularjs-webpack-starter

A complete, yet simple, starter for AngularJS using Webpack and UI-Router.

This workflow serves as a starting point for building Angular 1.x applications using Webpack and UI-Router.

Based on and expanded from [Preboot angular-webpack starter](https://github.com/preboot/angular-webpack)

This starter application is designed to be easy to migrate to Angular 2.
* Uses a file structure that follows the [Angular 2 Style Guide](https://angular.io/styleguide).
* Uses the component() method to define the directive.
* Uses ES6/2015 throughout with controller directives implemented as a class.
* No standalone controllers or use of $scope.

Other features:
* Bare-bones app with Home and About page.
* Heavily commented webpack configuration with reasonable defaults and Babel transpilation.
* Source maps included in all builds.
* Webpack development server with live reload.
* Production builds with cache busting.
* Testing environment using karma and protractor to run tests and jasmine as the framework.
* Code coverage when tests are run.
* No gulp and no grunt, just npm scripts.

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)

## Installing

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

## Developing

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch: `npm start`

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`

#### 1. End-to-End Tests

* start server: `npm start`
* run tests in a separate window: `npm run e2e`
